            Katara is my favorite cartoon character. She, with her brother, Sokka, is the person who found the main character of the series, while he was stuck inside an iceberg. She is brave, strong, and loyal. She hates when people betray her, and wants revenge from the person who killed her mom. She can hold grudges for a long time and is like a mother, keeping the group together. In fact, most of the time she is the reason they are alive. I love that, by the end of the series, she is independent and can defeat one of the strongest characters in the series, Azula.
